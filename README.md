# What is Jays_Core?

- This script is mainly for a server that I am currently working on, it's main goal is to compile lots of small features together in one place to save on resoucre count where not needed. I am activley trying to keep thread counts down in order to maintain a less intensive script.

# FEATURES:

1. 'Anti-Cheat' Technically this is not an anti-cheat, I have created loads of fake events that do not trigger anywhere, so when someone joins the server with a cheat menu and they look through the list of availible functions to trigger to gain money etc, they see a list from this resource that will appeal to their cheating ways, all it takes is for them to trigger once function and they will be automatically kicked from the server and their discord information will be sent into a logging channel that you can set up.
