# What is Jays_Core?

- This script is mainly for a server that I am currently working on, it's main goal is to compile lots of small features together in one place to save on resoucre count where not needed. I am activley trying to keep thread counts down in order to maintain a less intensive script.

# Feature

1. 'Anti-Cheat'
